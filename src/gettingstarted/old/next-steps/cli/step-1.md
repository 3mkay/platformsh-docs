# Getting Started with the Platform.sh CLI

## Some initial requirements

Before we install the [Platform.sh CLI](/gettingstarted/cli.md), there are a few small requirements that need to be set up before we can begin.

1. **Git**

   [Git](/gettingstarted/tools.md#git) is the open source version control system that is utilized by Platform.sh.

   Any change you make to your Platform.sh project will need to be committed via Git. You can see all the Git commit messages of an environment in the `Environment Activity` feed of the management console.

   Before getting started, make sure you have it installed on your computer.
   
2. **RSA key pair**

   Once your account has been set up and the CLI is installed, Platform.sh needs one addition piece of information about your computer so that you can access you projects from the command line.
  
   If you are unfamiliar with how to generate an RSA public and private key, there are excellent instructions in the documentation about [how to do so](/gettingstarted/tools.md#ssh).
  

Once you made sure that you have met these two requirements, we're ready to place our public key on Platform.sh and start developing.
