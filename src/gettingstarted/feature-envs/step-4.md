## Merge into production

The best way to understand a tool is to use it.  We believe that the best marketing we can offer for Platform.sh is to let you try it out, which is why we offer a free one month trial.

1. Visit the [Platform.sh accounts](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) page to set up your trial account.

2. Fill out your information to set up your account.

3. Alternatively, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose this option, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.
