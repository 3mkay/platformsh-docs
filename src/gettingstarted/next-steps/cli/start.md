# Getting Started with the Platform.sh CLI

The [management console]() allows you to create project environments and control how they are run with Platform.sh, but you can get even more control over your development process by using the Platform.sh CLI. 

The CLI is the official tool to use and manage your Platform.sh projects directly from your terminal. Anything you can do within the management console can be done with the CLI. Behinds the scenes it uses both the Git interface and our REST API.

Let's install the CLI and get started creating projects from the command line.
