# External Integrations

While you can host your application repository entirely on Platform.sh, it's likely that you will want to integrate your deployments with you pre-existing service. Platform.sh can be easily integrated with external services such as GitHub, Gitlab, or Bitbucket. 

Choose your current service, and this guide will take you through the steps to mirror your repository on Platform.sh and have environments created automatically for your pull requests and branches.

<html>
<head>
    <title>Language Template Buttons</title>
    <script src="jquery.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(function(){
            $("#includedContent").load("/gettingstarted/integrations/integrations.html");
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="includedContent"></div>

These steps assume that you have already:

* Signed up for a [free trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) with Platform.sh.
* [Pushed your own code](/gettingstarted/own-code.md) to Platform.sh.
