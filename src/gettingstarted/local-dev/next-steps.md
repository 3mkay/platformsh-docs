# Local Development

## Next steps

In this guide you opened an SSH tunnel to your Platform.sh project and built your application locally.

Don't stop now! There are far more features that make Platform.sh profoundly helpful to developers that you have left to explore.

### Developing on Platform.sh

Once an application has been migrated to Platform.sh, there's plenty more features that will help improve your development life cycle.

<div id = "dev-envs"></div>

<script>
    var descTitle = "Development environments";
    var descDesc = "Activate development branches and test new features before merging into production";
    var descPath = getPathObj("/gettingstarted/dev-environments.html", descTitle, descDesc);
    var descButton = {type: "descriptive", path: descPath, div: "dev-envs"};
    makeButton(descButton);
</script>
