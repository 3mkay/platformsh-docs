# Developing with Platform.sh: Local Development

Now that you have a project on Platform.sh, it would be helpful to run the same build process on your local machine so tht you can develop and test new features before pushing them.

The local build process will look similar to a remote build, however if your application requires access to services in order to run properly, there are a few additional steps you will need to go through before you can get started.

These steps assume that you have already:

* Signed up for a [free trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) with Platform.sh.
* Started either a [template project](/gettingstarted/template.md) or [pushed your own code](/gettingstarted/own-code.md) to Platform.sh.

If you have not completed these steps by now, click the links and do so before you begin.
