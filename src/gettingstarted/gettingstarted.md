# Getting Started

The best way to understand a tool is to use it.  We believe that the best marketing we can offer for Platform.sh is to let you try it out, which is why we offer a free one month trial.

To begin, create a new [free trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup).

Sign up with a new user and password or login using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you use a 3rd party login you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.
