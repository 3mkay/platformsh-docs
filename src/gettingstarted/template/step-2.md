# Start with a template

## Create a new project from a template

In the previous step, you set up a free trial account with Platform.sh and now you have access to the Platform.sh management console. 

From here you can create projects, adjust account settings, and a lot more that we will explore throughout these Getting Started guides.

First, we want to create our new template project:


1. **Name your project**

   Give your project a name like `My First Project` and then click `Next`.

2. **Set code base**

   Now you will be able to see the large collection of Platform.sh's supported templates. They are simple applications, but they could also be the starting place for you to build more interesting applications from.

   If you are more comfortable with a particular language, click the dropdown labeled `All languages` to select the language you like working with and the templates will update.

   Select a template and click `Next`.

3. **Plan size**

   The management console gives you the option of selecting your plan size from the very beginning, but you can upgrade your plan on the Accounts page later as well.

   For now, select the default `Professional Standard` plan size and click `Next`.

4. **Project region**

   The last step for setting up our new project is to configure its region.

   Select the region that most closely matches the region of where you think most of your traffic will come from and click `Next`.
