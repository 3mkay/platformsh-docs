## Next steps

In this guide you created a project using the [management console](/administration/web.md) and installed the [Platform.sh CLI](/development/cli.md). 

Don't stop now! There are far more features that make Platform.sh profoundly helpful to developers that you have left to explore.

### Import your own code

Templates are great, but configuring your own application to run on Platform.sh is just as easy.
