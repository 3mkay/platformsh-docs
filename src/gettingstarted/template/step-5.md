Once you have configured the template application in the previous step, Platform.sh will build your project for you.

1. **The management console**

   When the build screen has cleared, Platform.sh will return you to the management console. This time, however, you will be on the main page for your new project, `My First Project`.
   
   From here, you can control the settings of this project, as well as monitor its status.
   
   In the `Environments` box, click on `Master`.
   
2. **Check the build status**

   As Platform.sh completes its build, take a minute to notice the information available on this page.
   
   * **Overview**
   
      In this box, the `Master` environment, which is a live environment build from the `master` branch of our project, will have a status of `Building`. 
      
      Once that status has updated to `Active`, the site is live.
      
      ![Build status](/images/getting-started/first-project/build-status.png)
      
   * **Environment Activity**
   
      In this box, you can see what we have done so far has two initial entries: `My First Project` was created, and a template profile was initialized based on the template you chose in the previous step.

3. **Done!**

   That's it! Once the build status has changed to `Active`, you're application has been deployed on Platform.sh.
   
   You can view the template now by clicking on the link that is now visible for the `Master` environment under the Overview box. 
   
   It will open another tab in your browser to your new live site!
