# Start with a template

## Open a free trial account

The best way to understand a tool is to use it, that's why Platform.sh offers a free one month trial.

Visit the [Platform.sh accounts](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) page and fill out your information to set up your trial account.

Alternatively, you can sign up using an existing GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account. If you choose this option, you will be able to set a password for your Platform.sh account later.
