# Start with a template

## Build, Deploy, Done!

Once you have configured the template application in the previous step, Platform.sh will build your project for you.

1. **Explore the management console**

   When the build screen has cleared, Platform.sh will return you to the management console. Since you now have a project on your account, a version of this page will be what you see each time you visit the console.
   
   You will start on the main page for your new project, `My First Project`. From here, you can control the settings of this project and monitor its status.
   
   In the `Environments` box, click on `Master`.
   
2. **Check the build status**

   Take a minute to notice some the information available on this page.
   
   * **Overview**
   
      In this box the `Master` environment, which is a live environment build from the `master` branch of our application code, will have a status of `Building`. 
            
      Once that status has updated to `Active`, the build is complete and the application has deployed.
      
   * **Environment Activity**
   
      In this box, you can see what you have done so far has two initial entries: `My First Project` was created, and the template profile you chose was initialized on the environment.
         
3. **Done!**

   That's it! Once the build status has changed to `Active`, you're application has been deployed on Platform.sh.
   
   You can view the template now by clicking on the link that is now visible for the `Master` environment under the Overview box. It will open another tab in your browser to your new live site!
      
   
In these few steps you have created a free trial account, configured a template application on a project and deployed it using the management console entirely from your browser. 

Using the [Platform.sh CLI](/development/cli.md), however, you get even more control over your project configurations, and you are able to migrate your own applications to Platform.sh. Move onto the next step to install it.

    var navNextText = "I have built and deployed a template application";
    var navButtons = {type: "navigation", prev: getPathObj("prev"), next: getPathObj("next", navNextText), div: "buttons"};
    makeButton(navButtons);
</script>
