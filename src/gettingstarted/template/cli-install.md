## Next Steps: Installing the Platform.sh CLI

1. **Install the CLI**

    In your terminal run the following command:

    * **Installing on OSX or Linux**
    
       ```bash
       curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
       ```
       
    * **Installing on Windows**
    
       ```bash
       curl https://platform.sh/cli/installer -o cli-installer.php
       php cli-installer.php
       ```
   
2. **Authenticate and Verify**

   Once the installation has completed, you can run the CLI in your terminal with the command
   
   ```bash
   platform
   ```

    {% asciinema_local %}/asciinema/recordings/verify-cli-extended.cast{% endasciinema_local %}
   
   You should now be able to see a list of your Platform.sh projects, including the template you made in this guide.
   
That's it! Now that you have the management console set up and the CLI installed on your computer, you're well on your way to exploring all of the ways that Platform.sh can improve your development workflow.

Take a minute to explore some of the commands available with the CLI by using the command `platform list`.
