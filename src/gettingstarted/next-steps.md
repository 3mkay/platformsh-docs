# Next Steps

At this point you have used the management console to [create a trial account and deploy a template project](/gettingstarted/first-project.md) to Platform.sh. 

Don't stop now! 

We're just starting to introduce the tools that will take your development to the next level.


## CLI

The management console gives you additional control over your project, however as you are developing with Platform.sh you will find yourself wanting even more features than it provides. 

You can also create new template projects from the command line using the [Platform.sh CLI](/gettingstarted/cli.md), which will provide you with the ability to control more advanced aspects of your projects and better integration into your existing workflow.

## Live Development Environments

Now we get into the feature that really sets Platform.sh apart. 

Platform.sh is based on [Git](/gettingstarted/tools.md#git), which you will undoubtedly already be using in your development workflow. Get started here to see how you can turn development branches into live environments to test your new feature, and be confident when you finally merge that feature into production.

## Making changes to a project

At different times during the development process, you may want to make changes to your project that don't have to do with the application code itself. 

You may find that the plan size you initially selected is not large enough to handle your application and want to upgrade it, or that you want to add collaborators to the code base and add more environments to handle each of those new people working on a new feature environment independently. 

All of these changes can be made either through the management console or the CLI.

Now that you have learned the basics of Platform.sh using the management console and the CLI, it's time to get into the details of your favorite languages.
