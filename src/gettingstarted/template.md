# Start with a template

![Deploy a Template](/images/pretty/home-deploy.png)

Welcome to Platform.sh! Getting started is as easy as opening a free trial account and initializing a template. 

There are no requirements on your part at this point. This guide will take you from zero to hero - from first glance to a deployed application entirely from your browser. 

<html>
   <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/styles.css">
      <script type = "text/javascript" src = "/scripts/buttons/buttons.js" ></script>
   </head>
   <body>
   <div id = "buttons"></div>
   <script>
   var buttonTextNext = "Get started!";
   makeButtons("nextOnly", buttonTextNext);
   </script>
   </body>
</html>
