# Start with a template

![Deploy a Template](/images/pretty/home-deploy.png)

Welcome to Platform.sh! Getting started is as easy as opening a free trial account and initializing a template. 

There are no requirements on your part at this point. This guide will take you from zero to hero - from first glance to a deployed application entirely from your browser. 

<div id = "buttons"></div>

<script>
    var navNextText = "Get started!";
    var navButtons = {type: "navigation", next: getPathObj("next", navNextText), div: "buttons"};
    makeButton(navButtons);
</script>
