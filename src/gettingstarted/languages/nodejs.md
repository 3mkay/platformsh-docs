# Getting started with Node.js

Platform.sh supports building and deploying your application written in Node.js, and additional information not found in the below guides can be found in the [Node.js documentation](/languages/nodejs.md).

## Building your Node.js project locally

If you have gone through the previous Getting Started guides up to this point, you should have two template projects already built and deployed on your Platform.sh account.

Developing remotely isn't an option, and it makes sense that you would like to be able to build your application on your computer to develop your features before pushing to Platform.sh.

## Configuring your Node.js development for Platform.sh

Now that you've mastered the [management console](/gettingstarted/first-project.md) and the [CLI](/gettingstarted/next-steps/cli/start.md) to create a new projects and are able to create [live development environments](/gettingstarted/next-steps/dev-envs/start.md) to test new project features, you're now more than equipped to migrate your existing applications to Platform.sh. 

All it takes is including a few configuration files and you're all set to work with Platform.sh.
