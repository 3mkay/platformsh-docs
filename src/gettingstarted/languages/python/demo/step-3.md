# Platform.sh from scratch

## Build, Deploy, Done!

Once you have configured the template application in the previous step, Platform.sh will build the app on your project.

1. **The management console**

   When the build screen has cleared, Platform.sh will return you to the management console. This time, however, you will be on the main page for your new project, `My First Project`.
   
   From here, you can control the settings of this project, as well as monitor its status.
   
2. **Check the environment**

   In the `Environments` box, click on `Master`.
   
3. **Check the build status**

   As Platform.sh completes its build, take a minute to notice the information available on this page.
   
   * **Overview**
   
      In this box, the `Master` environment, which is a live environment build from the `master` branch of our project, will have a status of `Building`. 
      
      Once that status has updated to `Active`, the site is live.
      
   * **Environment Activity**
   
      In this box, you can see what we have done so far has two initial entries: `My First Project` was created, and a template profile was initialized based on the template you chose in the previous step.
   
4. **Done!**

   That's it! Once the build status has changed to `Active`, you're application has been deployed on Platform.sh.
   
   You can view the template now by clicking on the link that is now visible for the `Master` environment under the Overview box. 
   
   It will open another tab in your browser to your new live site!
   
   
In these few steps you have created a free trial account, configured a maintained template for your project and deployed it using the management console in your browser. 

Platform.sh provides far more features and control that we have covered here, so we will next explore how to get started with the Platform.sh CLI and the languages you already use!
