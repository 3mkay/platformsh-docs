# Platform.sh from scratch

## Open a free trial account

The best way to understand a tool is to use it.  We believe that the best marketing we can offer for Platform.sh is to let you try it out, which is why we offer a free one month trial.

1. Visit the [Platform.sh accounts](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) page to set up your trial account.
