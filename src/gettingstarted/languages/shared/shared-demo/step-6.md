# Getting Started with the Platform.sh CLI

## Verify

You have now created and initialized a template project using the Platform.sh CLI. Congratulations!

Now you can verify that your application is ready to with the command

```bash
platform url
```

This command will return a number of urls, which are different routes to your application, something we will learn how to configure very soon in these guides.

Select the first url, `0`, and press Enter, and a new browser window will open to your completed application.

{% asciinema_local %}/scripts/asciinema/recordings/list.json{% endasciinema_local %}


> Now you have created a template application using both the management console and the CLI, which is a great start to seeing how easy it is to deploy applications with Platform.sh
>
> But you didn't come here to deploy templates. 
> 
> Platform.sh gives better tools for developers by providing ***live development environments***. You're creating a new feature for an application and you want to test it live so that you can be sure nothing breaks when you merge into production. 
> 
> Live development environments are where Platform.sh really shines, so let's explore how you can use them in the next Getting Started guide.
