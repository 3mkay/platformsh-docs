# Platform.sh from scratch


Welcome to Platform.sh! Getting started is as easy as opening a free trial account and initializing one of our maintained templates on a new project. 

There are no requirements on your part at this point. This guide will take you from zero to hero - from first glance to a completely built and deployed application entirely in your browser.
